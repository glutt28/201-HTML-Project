                    <h3>Our Founder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Michael Mathew — or simply Mathew to friends and regulars — is the passionate mind behind this coffee haven. With a solid background in IT engineering and a long list of achievements in tech certifications, education mentorship, math olympiads, and martial arts, Mathew brings a rare mix of structure and soul into everything he builds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An alumnus of the Sumatera Institute of Technology, Mathew spent much of his student life nestled in coffee shop corners — learning, coding, reading, and reflecting with an Americano in hand. To him, a coffee shop has always been more than just a place to grab a drink; it’s a space for focus, stillness, and inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Driven by a dream to create a space that feels like home, Mathew built this café not just to serve great coffee, but to offer a warm, welcoming atmosphere where people can pause, breathe, and just be. Coming from a humble family background, the journey here was far from easy — but it’s one he pursued with heart and perseverance.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        When he’s not working behind the scenes, you might find Mathew strumming a guitar, practicing Pencak Silat or boxing, swimming, cycling, or simply jogging at sunrise. And, of course, always coding — still a passion close to his heart.
